# Solenoid-Field-Simulation
Program to simulate the magnetic field between two solenoids.

## Usage
It calculates the magnetic field vector at a point in space by dividing each solenoid into a finite number of small segments and applying the biot-savart law. A generated plot of the vector field is created by running the octave file.
